What did I work on last time? 
- created History class
- added honor codes

What do I plan to work on now?  
- write sprint3 backlog
- create stack class/initialize stack for popd/pushd
- implement history command

Am I blocked on anything?  
- need other classes to be written before I can test for functionality in JShell
