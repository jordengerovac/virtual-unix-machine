What did I work on last time? 
- made files for all classes
- wrote input into string/function calls from OperatingSystem in JShell
- wrote initialization of OperatingSystem and History objects
- wrote input recording in JShell

What do I plan to work on now?  
- create History class
- create Directory class
- create File class

Am I blocked on anything?  
- need other classes to be written before I can test for functionality in JShell
