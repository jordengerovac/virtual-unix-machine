What did I work on last time?
-Finished creating the Directory.java
-Finished creating the File.java
-Created the setup of OperatingSystem.java with instance variables and 
 constructor.
-Created the mkdir method.

What do I plan to do now?
-Finish the part of mkdir method where we make directory when user provides a 
 full path.
-Once I am finished mkdir, I will start working on another method after 
 consulting with the team members.

Am I blocked on anything?
-I am trouble iterating through the tree to check if a child exists because 
 I need that to write the second part of mkdir method.
